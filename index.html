    Ten Little Indians is a nursery rhyme referenced in the 1939 Agatha Christie novel <em><b>And Then There Were None</b></em>.<br><br>

    The rhyme:</p>
    <pre>
    Ten little Indian boys went out to dine;
    One choked his little self and then there were nine.
    Nine little Indian boys sat up very late;
    One overslept himself and then there were eight.
    Eight little Indian boys traveling in Devon;
    One said he'd stay there and then there were seven.
    Seven little Indian boys chopping up sticks;
    One chopped himself in halves and then there were six.
    Six little Indian boys playing with a hive;
    A bumblebee stung one and then there were five.
    Five little Indian boys going in for law;
    One got in Chancery and then there were four.
    Four little Indian boys going out to sea;
    A red herring swallowed one and then there were three.
    Three little Indian boys walking in the zoo;
    A big bear hugged one and then there were two.
    Two Little Indian boys sitting in the sun;
    One got frizzled up and then there was one.
    One little Indian boy left all alone;
    He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.</pre>
